# doc_samples

This repository contains sample documentation and sample code.  It exists to provide easy access to these resources for prospective employers to review the kind of work I've done over the years.

I've organized the samples into subdirectories with self-explanatory names.  For a little more detail about both the documentation and the code, see [http://www.drewhodge.org][1].
