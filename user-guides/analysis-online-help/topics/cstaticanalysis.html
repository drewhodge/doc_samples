<h1 class="topictitle1">Static analysis</h1>
<div><p class="id_shortdesc_id">In IBM<sup>®</sup> Rational<sup>®</sup> products, you can use the
static analysis capabilities to analyze the components and resources of an
application without having to run the application.</p>
<p>Dynamic testing of an application means that you must run that application.
You can perform static analysis at an any stage in the development cycle.
Running analyses early in the development cycle helps you to find and correct
problems that might be difficult to manage during the test phase later in
the cycle.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Static analysis code reviews, for example, compare the source code of an
application with a set of coding standards to ensure that the source code
complies with those standards, to find unwanted dependencies, and to ensure
that the intended structural design of the code is maintained.</p>
<p>If you must work with unfamiliar source code, or you need to understand
how an application is designed, you can run an automated architectural discovery
analysis. Architectural discovery identifies patterns in source code and reveals
how the components in the patterns are connected.</p>
