<h1 class="topictitle1">Code reviews</h1>
<div><p>A static analysis code review compares the source code of an application
with a set of coding standards to ensure that the source code complies with
those standards, to find unwanted dependencies, and to ensure that the intended
structural design of the code is maintained.</p>
<p>The automated code reviews that are part of the analysis feature, comprise
categorized sets of rules that focus on particular aspects of software quality
(such as globalization) and compliance (such as J2EE best practices). For
example, among several subcategories of J2EE best practices, the Maintainability
category contains rules that can find code that might be difficult to maintain
in J2EE applications. </p>
<p>When a code review finds source code that conflicts with a rule, it generates
a result. Code review results recommend the action you should take to overcome
existing problems, or avoid potential problems, before they can affect the
performance of an application, its maintenance, security, or scalability.
Automated code reviews are fast, so you can run code reviews often throughout
the development life cycle of your application or product.</p>
<p> Running regular automated code reviews during the software development
process can provide the following benefits:</p>
<ul><li>Identify bugs in the source code</li>
<li>Check for conformance with best practices</li>
<li>Explain each result and provide solutions for it</li>
<li>Provide an automated fix for typical results</li>
<li>Provide rules that you can share to ensure that your team follows the
specified application design and standards</li>
</ul>
<div class="p">The Code Review for Javaâ„¢ domain provides rules in the following
rule categories: <ul><li>Design Principles</li>
<li>Globalization</li>
<li>J2EE Best Practices</li>
<li>J2EE Security</li>
<li>J2SE Best Practices</li>
<li>J2SE Security</li>
<li>Naming</li>
<li>Performance</li>
<li>Private API</li>
