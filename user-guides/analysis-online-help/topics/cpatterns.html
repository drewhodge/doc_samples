<div><p>When you run an architectural discovery analysis, you can choose
to identify several patterns in your Javaâ„¢ source code. Each pattern is a commonly
seen solution or pitfall in designing and writing software.</p>
<p>The Architectural Discovery for Java domain provides rule categories and
rules that identify the following patterns:</p>
<ul><li>Design patterns, which include some of the classic Gang of Four patterns</li>
<li>Object-oriented patterns, which include abstraction and inheritance trees</li>
<li>Structural patterns, which include patterns based on irregular structural
connectivity between components, including antipatterns such as cyclic dependencies</li>
<li>System patterns, which detect all packages in the workspace</li>
</ul>

You can filter the results to display results that correspond to each rule in your analysis configuration, or only those results that do not conform to a particular rule. From the Analysis Results view, you can also open results to study the relationships between the components of your code.">Viewing architectural discovery results</a></div>
