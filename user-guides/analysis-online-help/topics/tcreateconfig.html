<h1 class="id_title_id">Creating and editing static analysis configurations</h1>
<div><p class="id_shortdesc_id"><em class="anchor_top_anchor"></em>In IBM<sup>®</sup> Rational<sup>®</sup> products,
you can create an analysis configuration that specifies the domain, rule categories,
and rules with which to analyze your resources. </p>
<div class="id_prereq_id">To create an analysis configuration, you
must be working in a perspective that supports analysis capabilities. <em class="anchor_prereq_anchor"></em></div>
<div class="section">When you create an analysis configuration, you determine the type
of analysis that you want to perform, its scope, and the particular rules
to apply to the resources. <p>You can analyze the resources in an entire workspace,
in a resource working set that you define, or in a project. By analyzing a
resource working set, you minimize the code base to be analyzed and decrease
the time the analysis takes. Your working set might consist of only the most
relevant code or it might be a smaller subset of the code in your workspace.</p>
<p>To
create an analysis configuration:</p>
</div>
<ol><li class="stepexpand"><span>Click <span class="menucascade"><span class="uicontrol">Run</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Analysis</span></span>.</span></li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>In the <span class="wintitle">Analysis</span> window, in the <span class="wintitle">Configurations</span> pane,
click <span class="uicontrol">Analysis</span> and click <span class="uicontrol">New</span>.</span></li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>In the <span class="uicontrol">Name</span> field, type a name for the configuration.</span></li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>To set the scope of your analysis, click the <span class="uicontrol">Scope</span> tab
and complete one of the following steps:</span><ul><li>To analyze the resources in an entire workspace, click <span class="uicontrol">Analyze
entire workspace</span>. The rules that you select on the <span class="wintitle">Rules</span> page
are applied to all the resources in your workspace.</li>
<li>To analyze the resources in a resource working set that you have defined
previously, click <span class="uicontrol">Analyze a resource working set</span>. The
rules that you select on the <span class="wintitle">Rules</span> page are applied to
a specific set of projects, folders, or files in your workspace.</li>
<li>To analyze projects in your workspace, click <span class="uicontrol">Analyze selected
projects</span>. The rules that you select on the <span class="wintitle">Rules</span> page
are applied to the resources in the project you select.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>To specify the rule categories, rules, or rule sets to apply during
the analysis, click the <span class="uicontrol">Rules</span> tab and complete one
of the following steps:</span><ul><li>In the <span class="uicontrol">Analysis domains and rules</span> field, expand
the tree and select providers, rule categories, and rules. To select all the
rules defined by the provider or rule category, select a top-level provider
or rule category. </li>
<li>To import a file that describes a custom rule set, click <span class="uicontrol">Import</span>. </li>
<li>In the <span class="uicontrol">Rule sets</span> field, type the name of a
custom rule set, or click a defined rule set; then click <span class="uicontrol">Set</span> to
configure the providers, rule categories, and rules to perform a specific
analysis.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="stepexpand">Optional: <span>To show any configuration or additional information
that might exist for a rule, and to change the severity rating and other rule
parameters, click the rule; then click <span class="uicontrol">Details</span>.</span></li>
