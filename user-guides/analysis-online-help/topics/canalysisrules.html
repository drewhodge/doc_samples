<h1 class="id_title_id">Rules and rule categories for static analysis</h1>
<div><p class="id_shortdesc_id"><em class="anchor_top_anchor"></em>Rules
are the smallest building blocks of a static analysis configuration. Each
analysis configuration applies different rules, or sets of rules, that define
the conditions that generate results and that assess the quality, or determine
the structure, of resources. A rule category is a collection of analysis rules,
or other categories, that focuses on a particular aspect of standards compliance,
or on an accepted practice.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Rules</h2><p>A rule is a specific statement that describes
an action to follow when you write code, or a description of a particular
solution to a commonly encountered problem in software design.</p>
<p>The following
list shows examples of code review rules and architectural discovery patterns:</p>
<ul><li>Avoid conditional expressions with more than four operators</li>
<li>Avoid nesting more than one class</li>
<li>Avoid nesting more than one <samp class="codeph">if</samp> statement</li>
<li>Factory method</li>
<li>Inheritance tree</li>
<li>Component tangle</li>
<li>Package</li>
</ul>
<p>Rules form the basis of an analysis configuration. When you run an
analysis, you check whether the resources comply with a specific rule, or
set of rules. You can modify rules and create user-defined rules if you need
them to apply to specific application design standards. The code review rules
listed earlier, for example, belong to the design principles category. Rules
that apply to similar capabilities, or code structures, belong to the same
category. You can apply rules from several categories depending on the purpose
of the review. </p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="id_title_id3">Rule categories</h2><p>Analysis
domains are components of the analysis framework that implement groups of
tools that contain categories. You can select different domains for different
types of analysis and, depending on the requirements of your analysis, you
can enable or disable a rule category and individual rules in the category.</p>
<p>An
example of a rule category is the performance category in the Code Review
for Javaâ„¢ domain.
Performance, as an important aspect of the overall quality of an application,
should be one of the characteristics you test in a code review.  The performance
rule category has three subcategories, memory, profiling, and speed, each
of which contains a set of rules that you apply to source code when you run
an analysis with this category selected.</p>
<p>An example of a rule category
in the Architectural Discovery for Java domain is the object-oriented patterns
category. This category contains rules that identify abstraction and inheritance
tree patterns, which identify an abstract class or interface and the implementation
or extension of a class.</p>
