<div><p>The Structural patterns rule category contains patterns that show
various types of structural elements, including structural antipatterns.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Purpose</h2>The following table lists each pattern, and
its purpose, in the Structural Patterns category:</div>
<table cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="" border="1" class="simpletableborder"><tr><th valign="bottom" align="left" id="d0e32">Pattern</th>
<th valign="bottom" align="left" id="d0e34">Purpose</th>
</tr>
<tr><td valign="top" headers="d0e32">Component Cyclic Dependency</td>
<td valign="top" headers="d0e34">A Component Cyclic Dependency pattern is a structural antipattern
that consists of interdependent components. A cyclic dependency between components
is considered a major architectural flaw. Such a dependency makes the code
difficult to understand and maintain. More important, cyclic dependencies
compromise software testing, parallel development, and reuse. Large-scale
software with many cyclic dependencies is fragile and unstable. </td>
</tr>
<tr><td valign="top" headers="d0e32">Component Global Breakable</td>
<td valign="top" headers="d0e34">A Component Global Breakable pattern is a structural antipattern
for a system component that is often affected when any other component is
changed. Except for high-level concrete implementations, global breakables
are undesirable because they indicate fragility and lack of modularity in
the system. </td>
</tr>
<tr><td valign="top" headers="d0e32">Component Global Butterfly</td>
<td valign="top" headers="d0e34">A Component Global Butterfly pattern is a structural pattern for
an object that has many global dependents. Changes to a global butterfly often
have a significant impact on the rest of the system. For this reason, a global
butterfly should only be either a basic system interface or a utility class. </td>
</tr>
<tr><td valign="top" headers="d0e32">Component Global Hub</td>
<td valign="top" headers="d0e34">A Component Global Hub pattern is a structural antipattern for a
component that has many global dependencies and many global dependents. A
global hub is often affected when anything is changed, and it affects a significant
percentage of the system when it changes. Global hubs are undesirable because
they indicate fragility and lack of modularity in the system. </td>
</tr>
<tr><td valign="top" headers="d0e32">Component Local Breakable</td>
<td valign="top" headers="d0e34">A Component Local Breakable pattern is a structural antipattern for
a component that has many immediate dependencies. Such a component carries
excessive responsibility and is usually identified by many long methods. Breakables
make the code difficult to understand, maintain, and reuse.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td valign="top" headers="d0e32">Component Local Butterfly	</td>
<td valign="top" headers="d0e34">A Component Local Butterfly pattern is a structural pattern for a
component that has many immediate dependents. Changes to a local butterfly
often have a significant immediate impact on the rest of the system. For this
reason, a local butterfly should only be either a basic system interface or

<td valign="top" headers="d0e34">A Component Local Hub pattern is a structural antipattern for a component
that has many immediate dependencies and many immediate dependents. Such a
component carries excessive responsibility and also serves as a utility or
commonly used component. Hubs make the code difficult to understand, maintain,
and reuse. Hubs also make the code fragile and unstable. </td>
</tr>
<tr><td valign="top" headers="d0e32">Package Cyclic Dependency</td>
<td valign="top" headers="d0e34">A Package Cyclic Dependency pattern is a structural antipattern that
consists of interdependent packages. A cyclic dependency between packages
is considered a major architectural flaw. Such a dependency makes the code
difficult to understand and to maintain. More importantly, cyclic dependencies
undermine testability, parallel development, and reuse. Large-scale software
with many cyclic dependencies is fragile and unstable. </td>

<tr><td valign="top" headers="d0e32">Package Global Breakable</td>
<td valign="top" headers="d0e34">A Package Global Breakable pattern is a structural antipattern for
a package that has many global dependencies. Such a package carries excessive
responsibility and usually contains several components with many global dependencies. </td>
