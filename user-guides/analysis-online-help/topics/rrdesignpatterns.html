<h1 class="topictitle1">Design patterns for architectural discovery analysis</h1>
<div><p>The Design Patterns rule category for architectural analysis contains
commonly seen solutions or pitfalls in designing and writing source code,
including some of the classic Gang of Four patterns.</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Purpose</h2><p>The following table lists each pattern,
and its purpose, in the Design Patterns category:</p>
</div>
<table cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="" border="1" class="simpletableborder"><tr><th valign="bottom" align="left" id="d0e34">Pattern</th>
<th valign="bottom" align="left" id="d0e36">Purpose</th>
</tr>
<tr><td valign="top" headers="d0e34">Decorator</td>
<td valign="top" headers="d0e36">The Decorator pattern adds responsibilities to an object dynamically,
without changing its interface. The Decorator pattern acts as a wrapper because
it implements the original interface, adds capabilities, and delegates work
to the original object, so you can use it as an alternative to creating a
subclass. The architectural discovery algorithm identifies this pattern as
consisting of two classes: Decorator and the wrapped component. </td>
</tr>
<tr><td valign="top" headers="d0e34">Factory Method</td>
<td valign="top" headers="d0e36">The Factory Method pattern defines an interface for creating objects
without knowing the class of the object it creates. Each Factory Method pattern
can define the class to be instantiated based on the input parameters and
specifics of the situation. The architectural discovery algorithm identifies
this pattern as consisting of Creator class, Concrete Creator subclass, Product
interface, and Concrete Product object. The Creator class specifies the interface
for creating a Product. The Concrete Creator subclass implements this interface
by instantiating a Concrete Product object.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td valign="top" headers="d0e34">Marker</td>
<td valign="top" headers="d0e36">The Marker pattern declares a semantic attribute of a class. The
architectural discovery algorithm identifies the Marker pattern as a single
empty interface without methods or constants. </td>
</tr>
<tr><td valign="top" headers="d0e34">Observer/Observable</td>
<td valign="top" headers="d0e36">The Observer/Observable pattern communicates the changes in the state
of an object to other system objects. The architectural discovery algorithm
identifies this pattern as consisting of Observer and Observable. The Observable
class maintains a list of Observer classes that it notifies when a state change
occurs. </td>
</tr>
<tr><td valign="top" headers="d0e34">Singleton</td>
<td valign="top" headers="d0e36">The Singleton pattern ensures that a class allows only one object
instance. The architectural discovery algorithm identifies the Singleton pattern
as a class with a private constructor and a public static field or method
that provides global access to the instance of a Singleton class.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td valign="top" headers="d0e34">Utility</td>
<td valign="top" headers="d0e36">The Utility pattern models a stateless utility function. The architectural
discovery algorithm identifies Utility as a class with a private constructor
that contains only static methods. </td>
</tr>
<tr><td valign="top" headers="d0e34">Visitor</td>
<td valign="top" headers="d0e36">The Visitor pattern performs specific operations on the elements
of an object structure. The Visitor pattern allows additional operations without
changing the classes of the elements on which they operate. The architectural
discovery algorithm identifies the Visitor pattern as consisting of Visitor
class, Concrete Visitor subclass, Element (optional) class, and Concrete Element
subclass. The Visitor pattern is an interface that declares the Visit operation
for every element. The Concrete Visitor subclass implements the Visitor interface
and acts on each Concrete Element subclass.</td>
