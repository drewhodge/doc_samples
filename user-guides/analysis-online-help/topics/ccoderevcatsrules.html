<h1 class="id_title_id">Rules and rule categories</h1>
<div><p class="id_shortdesc_id"><em class="anchor_top_anchor"></em>Rules
are the smallest building blocks of a static analysis configuration. Each
analysis configuration applies different rules, or sets of rules, that define
the conditions that generate results and that assess the quality of your resources.
A rule category is a collection of analysis rules, or other categories, that
focus on a particular aspect of standards compliance.</p>
<p>A rule is a specific statement that describes one action to follow when
you write code. For example, the following statements are code review rules:</p>
<ul><li>Avoid conditional expressions with more than four operators</li>
<li>Avoid nesting more than one class</li>
<li>Avoid nesting more than one <samp class="codeph">if</samp> statement</li>
</ul>
<p>Rules form the basis of an analysis configuration. When you perform an
analysis, you check whether your resources comply with a specific rule, or
set of rules. You can modify rules and create user-defined rules if you need
them to be more specific to your application design standards. The rules listed
earlier, for example, belong to the design principles category. Rules that
apply to similar capabilities, or code structures, belong to the same category.
You can apply rules from several categories depending on the purpose of your
review. </p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="id_title_id2">Severity levels</h2><p>Rule
authors assign a severity level to each rule to specify how seriously a resource
that conflicts with the rule deviates from the standards. Each rule has one
of the severity levels in the following table:</p>
<table cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="" border="1" class="simpletableborder"><tr><th valign="bottom" align="left" id="d0e105">Icon</th>
<th valign="bottom" align="left" id="d0e107">Severity level</th>
<th valign="bottom" align="left" id="d0e109">Description</th>
</tr>
<tr><td valign="top" headers="d0e105"><img class="id_image_id1" src="../images/tptp_recommend.gif" alt="Green check mark icon." /></td>
<td valign="top" headers="d0e107">Recommendation</td>
<td valign="top" headers="d0e109">This is the lowest severity level. The result indicates a problem
that is not serious, but that you should consider fixing soon.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td valign="top" headers="d0e105"><img class="id_image_id2" src="../images/tptp_warning.gif" alt="Brown exclamation point icon." /></td>
<td valign="top" headers="d0e107">Warning</td>
<td valign="top" headers="d0e109">This severity level indicates that a resource very likely has a problem
that you need to resolve.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td valign="top" headers="d0e105"><img class="id_image_id3" src="../images/tptp_severe.gif" alt="Purple cross icon." /></td>
<td valign="top" headers="d0e107">Severe</td>
<td valign="top" headers="d0e109">This is the highest severity level. It indicates that you should
resolve the problem that the result points to.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Although recommendation is the lowest level, it is still
important to address results with this severity level. Even if these results
are not immediate problems, they could lead to problems in the future. The
rules are based on a set of best practices and industry standards to which
development teams should adhere.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2 class="id_title_id3">Rule categories</h2><p>Analysis
domains are components of the analysis framework that implement groups of
tools that contain categories. You can select different domains for different
types of analysis and, depending on the requirements of your analysis, you
can enable or disable a rule category and individual rules in the category.</p>
<p>An
example of a rule category is the performance category for code reviews. Performance,
as an important aspect of the overall quality of an application, should be
one of the characteristics you test in a code review.  The performance rule
category has three subcategories, memory, profiling, and speed, each of which
contains a set of rules that you apply to your source code when you run an
analysis with this category selected.</p>
