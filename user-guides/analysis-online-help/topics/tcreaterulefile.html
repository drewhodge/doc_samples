<h1 class="topictitle1">Creating rules files</h1>
<div><p>You can create rules files that contain sets of rules to apply
during a static analysis code review that you can run outside a standard analysis
configuration at the command line, or in an Ant script.</p>
<div class="section">A rules file contains one or more analysis rules. When you create
a rules file, you work in the <span class="wintitle">Analysis</span> window to determine
the type of analysis to perform and the particular rules to export to the
rules file. For example, you can add to a rules file, a complete rule category,
such as J2SE best practices, or a subset of category, such as individual rules
that generate results if the code does not initialize static fields, or if
it calls the sleep() method inside a while loop.<p>To create a rules file:</p>
</div>
<ol><li><span>Click <span class="menucascade"><span class="uicontrol">Run</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Analysis</span></span>.</span></li>
<li><span>In the <span class="wintitle">Analysis</span> window, in the <span class="wintitle">Configurations</span> pane,
click <span class="uicontrol">Analysis</span> and click <span class="uicontrol">New</span>.</span></li>
<li><span>To specify the rule categories or rules to add to a rules file,
click the <span class="uicontrol">Rules</span> tab.</span></li>
<li><span>In the <span class="uicontrol">Analysis domains and rules</span> field,
expand the tree and select the Code Review for Javaâ„¢ domain, its rule categories, and rules.
To select all the rules defined by a rule category, select a top-level rule
category.</span></li>
<li>Optional: <span>To show any configuration or additional information
that might exist for a rule, and to change the severity rating and other rule
parameters, click the rule; then click <span class="uicontrol">Details</span>.</span></li>
<li><span>Click <span class="uicontrol">Export</span> and, in the <span class="uicontrol">File
name</span> field, type a name for the rules file.</span></li>
<li><span>Browse to the location to store the rules file; then click <span class="uicontrol">Save</span>.</span></li>

Each analysis configuration applies different rules, or sets of rules, that define the conditions that generate results and that assess the quality, or determine the structure, of resources. A rule category is a collection of analysis rules, or other categories, that focuses on a particular aspect of standards compliance, or on an accepted practice.">Rules and rule categories for static analysis</a></div>
