<h1 class="topictitle1">Command line code review</h1>
<div><p>You can run code reviews on Java™ source code from a command line in
a headless workbench, with no graphical user interface. This might be useful
if you want to run code reviews unattended on a regular basis.</p>
<p>A headless, or command line interface (CLI) for code review analyses enables
you to interact with the analysis feature in a textual environment. When you
run an analysis from the command line, you start an application called <span class="cmdname">com.ibm.xtools.analysis.AnalyzeApplication</span> using
the <span class="option">-application</span> option of <span class="cmdname">eclipse.exe</span>.
This invocation runs a headless Eclipse environment with only the core features
needed to run code reviews. AnalyzeApplication takes several options that
specify the scope of the analysis, the location of the source code, the rules
to apply, and the location of the analysis results. The application can also
write analysis results to stdout.</p>
<p>If you are working in a Microsoft<sup>®</sup> Windows<sup>®</sup> operating system, be aware that
there is a limit to the number of characters that you can use for command
line instructions. The following suggestions can help you reduce the length
of a command line instruction:</p>
<ul><li>Use variables in your PATH environment variable</li>
<li>Keep the path to your workspace as short as possible</li>
<li>Keep the path to the analysis results as short as possible</li>
</ul>
<p>You cannot run a code review in headless mode while the product graphical
user interface has the workspace open and locked. If you have Java source
code that is not in an Eclipse workspace, you can run a code review on the
code and create a worskpace at the same time.</p>
<div class="example"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Command line examples</h2>The following command line instruction
runs a code review on Java source code in an existing Eclipse
workspace on a Microsoft Windows operating system. It places
the results of the code review in XML and HTML formats in a directory called
