<h1 class="topictitle1">Running a code review</h1>
<div><p>You can run a code review on your Javaâ„¢ source code with an analysis configuration
that uses the Code Review for Java domain, it's rule categories, and rules.
In the analysis configuration, you can also determine the scope of an analysis,
the source code that you want to analyze.</p>
<div class="id_prereq_id">To run a code review analysis, you must
create an new analysis configuration, or work with an existing one.<em class="anchor_prereq_anchor"></em></div>
<div class="section">To run a code review:</div>
<ol><li><span>Click <span class="menucascade"><span class="uicontrol">Run</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Analysis</span></span>.</span></li>
<li><span>In the <span class="wintitle">Analysis</span> window, in the <span class="wintitle">Configurations</span> pane,
click an analysis configuration.</span></li>
<li><span>Click <span class="uicontrol">Analyze</span>.</span></li>
</ol>
<div class="section">While the analysis runs, the <span class="wintitle">Analysis Results</span> view
opens and, if your source code does not conform to the rules in the analysis
configuration, the view populates with results. The results are listed in
chronological order and are grouped into the same categories that you specified
in the analysis configuration.</div>
