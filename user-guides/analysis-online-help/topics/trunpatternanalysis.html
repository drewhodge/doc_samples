<h1 class="topictitle1">Running an architectural discovery analysis</h1>
<div><p>You can run an architectural discovery analysis on Javaâ„¢ source
code with an analysis configuration that uses the Architectural Discovery
for Java domain,
its rule categories, and rules. In the analysis configuration, you can also
determine the scope of an analysis, the source code that you want to analyze.</p>
<div class="id_prereq_id">To run an architectural discovery analysis
configuration, you must create an new configuration, or work with an existing
one.<em class="anchor_prereq_anchor"></em></div>
<div class="section">To run a architectural discovery analysis:</div>
<ol><li><span>Click <span class="menucascade"><span class="uicontrol">Run</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Analysis</span></span>.</span></li>
<li><span>In the <span class="wintitle">Analysis</span> window, in the <span class="wintitle">Configurations</span> pane,
click an analysis configuration.</span></li>
<li><span>Click <span class="uicontrol">Analyze</span>.</span></li>
</ol>
<div class="section">When the analysis runs, the <span class="wintitle">Analysis Results</span> view
opens and, if your source code contains any of the patterns, design patterns
or antipatterns, that you specified in the configuration's rules, the view
populates with results. The results are listed in chronological order and
are grouped into the same categories that you specified in the analysis configuration.</div>
