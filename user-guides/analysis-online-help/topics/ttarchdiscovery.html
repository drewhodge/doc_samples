<h1 class="topictitle1">Detecting patterns in Java source code</h1>
<div><p>You can learn about the architecture of an application by identifying
patterns in an application's code and by studying how the components in patterns
are connected. The process of such identification and study is called architectural
discovery.</p>
<div class="section"><p>You can run an architectural discovery analysis on all the code
in a workspace, on a resource working set of code, or on a project that you
specify. An architectural discovery analysis identifies a particular design
pattern by looking for code that constitutes the components, such as classes,
interfaces, and packages, that form the pattern. To study the relationships
and dependencies in detected patterns, you can open visual representations
of the patterns.</p>
<p>Running an architectural discovery analysis on an application's
code can provide the following benefits:</p>
<ul><li>Reduce the learning curve for understanding underlying patterns in an
existing software architecture<p>This approach helps especially when you work
with unfamiliar code. By studying visual representations, you can review classes
and interfaces that constitute design patterns to become familiar with the
architecture of an application. For example, you can study visualizations
of an abstraction in one diagram and an inheritance tree in another.</p>
</li>
<li>Help you make accurate deductions about an application <p>For example,
in the Factory Method pattern, a class is used to create other classes. So,
when you see a class in a visualization showing the Factory Method pattern,
you know that the class produces other classes.</p>
</li>
<li>Show the structural patterns and antipatterns that compose the software
application<p>This approach helps you detect good coding patterns to retain
and follow as well as coding patterns to avoid and correct.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Automated architectural discovery is an efficient way to gain an understanding
of how an application is designed.</p>

<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../topics/trunpatternanalysis.html">Running an architectural discovery analysis</a></strong><br />
You can run an architectural discovery analysis on Javaâ„¢ source code with an analysis configuration that uses the Architectural Discovery for Java domain, its rule categories, and rules. In the analysis configuration, you can also determine the scope of an analysis, the source code that you want to analyze.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../topics/tviewpatternanalysis.html">Viewing architectural discovery results</a></strong><br />
You can view the results of an architectural discovery analysis in the <span class="wintitle">Analysis Results</span> view. You can filter the results to display results that correspond to each rule in your analysis configuration, or only those results that do not conform to a particular rule. From the <span class="wintitle">Analysis Results</span> view, you can also open results to study the relationships between the components of your code.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../topics/rarchdiscref.html">Architectural discovery patterns</a></strong><br />
The Architectural Discovery for Java domain comprises four rule categories that contain the rules for identifying patterns and antipatterns in Java source code. This section contains topics that describe the patterns that an architectural discovery analysis can detect automatically.</li>
